# TODO
> For ai harness

## list
* [x] Upgrade system prompt
* [x] Enhance file write (almost file_edit?)
* [x] When use url_get, do not return raw html
* [x] Memory
* [x] Get user's input.(Choose from a list of options - multiple questions per call)
* [x] Skills (SKILL.md instruction packs, loaded on demand)
* [x] Session titles (AI-generated or set by hand with /title)
* [x] MCP servers (.mcp.json, stdio/http/sse, tools + resources + prompts)
* [x] Hide <tool_call> when the model talks before calling a tool
* [x] Reasoning models: keep <think> off the screen and out of the history
* [x] Tool permissions (.permissions.json allow/deny, 'a' at the prompt)
* [x] Several tool calls in one turn
* [x] Repair console input that arrives as surrogate escapes (Korean input on a cp949 console)
* [x] Raw <content> blocks so a file body never has to be escaped into JSON
* [x] Repair malformed tool JSON (unclosed brackets, flattened arguments, broken payload)
* [x] Ask the model to resend a tool call we could not parse, instead of ending the turn
* [x] run_cmd: no stdin + timeout, so an interactive program can no longer freeze the app
* [x] Live shell sessions: run_cmd hands the prompt to the model, send_input answers it
* [x] Waiting-for-input detection per platform (/proc on Linux, CPU elsewhere) + tests/test_platform.py
* [x] Decode command output by what it actually is (UTF-8, else the console code page)
* [x] /connect: Anthropic, OpenAI (+compatible), Gemini alongside Ollama
* [x] Pin dependencies to the versions that were actually tested (+ requirements-lock.txt)
* [x] Atomic file writes, so a crash cannot empty a session, the memory or the saved API keys
* [x] Token estimate that knows Korean from English, and calibrates against what providers report
* [x] One tool table (toolspec.py): the prompt is rendered from it, dispatch binds through it, drift is a startup error
* [x] Sub-agents: spawn_agent hires a second model for one job and returns only its report
* [x] Answer instead of a blank turn when a reasoning model thinks and says nothing
* [x] Native function calling for Anthropic, OpenAI and Gemini - same tool table, 12KB less prompt
* [x] Native tool calling on Ollama too, decided per model from what the model says it supports
* [x] A git commit per AI edit and /undo to take it back, toggled with /autocommit
* [x] Deepthink: plan -> check -> build -> review the real diff -> verify, driven by the harness
* [x] Stop a model that keeps calling a tool it has just been refused

## next
> See roadmap.md for the reasoning and the order.

* [ ] Auto-verify loop: run the project's tests after an edit and feed failures back
* [ ] Whole-project Tree-sitter index (symbol table) instead of plain text search
* [ ] Split the reusable parts out to PyPI (JSON repair, MCP client, shell sessions)
