"""Refuse a tag that is not the version in the code.

PyPI accepts a version number once. Not corrected afterwards, not replaced -
only yanked, which leaves it visible and installable by exact pin. So the one
check worth having before an upload is that the number about to be published is
the number the code says it is.

This runs on any tagged ref, not only on a release: v0.4.0 and v0.4.1 were both
tagged onto code that still said 0.3.1, and the first anyone heard of it was
TestPyPI rejecting a 0.3.1 wheel that had already been uploaded months earlier.
CI runs on a tag push, which is the moment that is still cheap to fix - a tag
can be moved, an upload cannot be taken back.
