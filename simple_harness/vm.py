"""A Python scratch process the model can compute and try things in.

`run_cmd` can already run `python3 -c "..."`, so why this exists:

* **The code does not have to survive a JSON string.** A snippet handed to
  `run_cmd` is a shell argument inside a JSON value, so it has to be escaped
  twice, and a 4B model gets that wrong more often than it gets it right. Here
  the code arrives in a `<content>` block, byte for byte, exactly like a file
  body - the same trick that made `write_file` work at all.
* **It remembers.** One process stays alive across calls and keeps its globals,
  so a model that cannot hold much in its head can work in small steps:
  compute, look, compute again. `run_cmd` starts from nothing every time.
* **It is a scratchpad, not the project.** The process runs in its own
  directory, so a stray `open(..., "w")` lands there instead of in the
  repository - and never in a git commit.
* **The last expression's value comes back.** `2 ** 10` on its own prints
  nothing under `python -c`; here it answers `1024`. A small model reaches for
  a calculator far more readily when the calculator answers.

What this is *not*: a security boundary. The code runs as the user, with the
user's files and the user's network, and there is no attempt to pretend
otherwise - the isolation here is from *mistakes*, not from a hostile program.
That is why `run_python` still goes through the approval prompt and still counts
as changing the world (`tools._CHANGES_THINGS`). What it does buy is that a
runaway loop, a 40GB allocation or a crash takes down a separate process and
not the harness.

The wire between here and the scratch process, since it is easy to get wrong:

    parent                            kernel (_DRIVER, run as its own file)
    ------                            -------------------------------------
    stdin  pipe  --- one JSON line -> read from a dup of fd 0
                                      (fd 0 itself is /dev/null, so code that
                                       reads stdin cannot eat the protocol)
    stdout pipe  <-- one JSON line --- written to a dup of fd 1
                                      (fd 1 and 2 are the capture file, so
                                       print, a C extension and a subprocess
                                       all land in the same place)
    capture file <------------------- everything the code printed
    read by us from the offset we left off at

Stdlib only, plus `shell_session` for the one thing that is genuinely hard to
get right twice - killing a process along with everything it started.
