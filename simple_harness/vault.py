"""The values in `.env`, kept out of the model and pasted back in by the harness.

A `.env` file is the one file in a project whose *contents* are the secret. The
model has every reason to want it - it is where the database URL and the API
keys are - and no reason at all to want the values. It needs to know that
`STRIPE_KEY` exists and to be able to *use* it; the sixty characters after the
`=` are for the machine.

Which matters here more than in most places, because a value the model reads
does not stay read:

* it goes to the provider, so a hosted model means the key is now Anthropic's
  or OpenAI's problem too;
* it is written into `~/.localchat/sessions/*.json` and stays there;
* the summariser may copy it into a `<SUMMARY>` that survives compression.

One `read_file` and the key is in three places it was never meant to be, none
of which the person watching would think to check.

So the harness reads the file and the model does not. What it is handed is

    STRIPE_KEY={{env:STRIPE_KEY}}

and when it sends that placeholder back - in a command, a URL, a header - the
harness puts the real value in on the way to the tool. The model can use a
secret it has never been told.

**What is filled in, and what is not.** `FILLED_IN` names it per tool, and the
rule behind the list is that a placeholder is expanded into what *runs* and
never into what is *saved*. `run_cmd` gets the real key because curl needs it;
`write_file` does not, because the alternative is the model being able to copy a
secret into a file by writing the placeholder and asking for it back. A
placeholder written to a file stays a placeholder, which is also exactly what
`.env.example` should contain.

**What is not covered.** A secret that is not in one of these files - typed
into the chat, invented by a command, pasted by the user - is not known here
and is not redacted. This narrows the biggest hole; it is not a guarantee, and
nothing here should be described to anybody as one.

Stdlib plus `paths`, so it can be imported from `systemprompt` - which `config`
imports at import time - without a cycle.
