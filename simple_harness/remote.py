"""This session, from the phone in your pocket.

A harness is a terminal, and a terminal is somewhere you have to be. That is
fine while the answer takes four seconds and wrong the moment it takes four
minutes: a `/deepthink` pass, a test suite the model is chasing, a sub-agent
reading half a repository. The work is happening on this machine and the
person has left the desk, so the two things they actually need - *what is it
doing* and *yes, go ahead* - are exactly the two things they cannot reach.

So the harness can hand out one door into the session it is already running.
`/remote on` opens an HTTP server on this machine, prints a URL with a token
in it, and anything that can open that URL is now at the prompt: it sees the
transcript as it is printed, types lines that arrive as if they had been typed
here, and answers the approval prompts that would otherwise sit waiting for a
keystroke from somebody who is on a train.

**It is a door into a shell.** Whoever holds the link can run what the person
at this keyboard can run. That is the feature, and it is also the whole of the
risk, so:

  * it is **off by default** and starts only on an explicit `/remote on`;
  * the token is generated per start, never saved, and never written into
    `settings.json` - there is no long-lived credential to leak. Loopback gets
    128 bits of it; `lan` gets 256, because that token is one that crosses a
    network somebody else is also on;
  * it binds **loopback** unless `/remote on lan` is typed, and that prints a
    warning naming what is now reachable;
  * where it is reachable over a network, **the link is not enough**: the
    browser is shown a box asking for six digits that were printed on *this
    terminal*, and gets a session key only when it sends them back. The token
    crosses the network to reach the phone and the terminal does not, which is
    the entire difference between a second factor and a second copy of the
    first. `REMOTE_PAIR` decides when it is asked for;
  * every request carries the token, compared with `secrets.compare_digest`;
  * wrong tokens are counted per address, and an address that has sent
    `REMOTE_MAX_BAD_TOKENS` of them is refused for `REMOTE_LOCKOUT` seconds -
    a 128-bit token is not guessable, but a door that lets somebody knock all
    afternoon without anyone hearing it is still the wrong door;
  * **the person is told who is there.** The first request from an address,
    and every attempt with a wrong token, becomes a line at the prompt. On a
    network you share, the useful question is not "could someone get in" but
    "did they", and nothing else here can answer it;
  * the `Host` header has to name this machine, which is what stops a page on
    the internet from walking into `127.0.0.1` through a rebound DNS name;
  * what is mirrored out goes through `vault.redact` first, so a `.env` value
    that is on the terminal because the person ran `!cat .env` is not also on
    the wire.

**What it is not.** This is plain HTTP. On loopback that is the whole story -
the bytes never leave the machine. Over `lan` they cross a network, and anyone
already on that network can read them: the transcript, and the token with it.
So `lan` is for a network you trust, and everything else is `ssh -L`, which is
somebody else's audited code and is why there is no tunnel and no TLS here.

**What the remote sees.** The screen, as text. Everything the harness prints
goes through `sys.stdout`, so mirroring is a tee installed on it rather than a
second rendering that would drift from the first: one transcript, two places,
and no second copy of the formatting to keep in step. ANSI is stripped, a line
being streamed is published as a `tail` before its newline arrives, and the
buffer is a ring (`REMOTE_LINES`) because a session outlives any phone screen.

**What the remote can do.** Type a line - a message or a slash command, both
go into the same loop by the same route - and answer a question. A line typed
remotely marks the turn it starts as *remotely driven*, and that is what
decides where the next approval prompt is asked: the person who started the
work is the person who gets asked to approve it. A question nobody answers
within `REMOTE_ASK_TIMEOUT` is refused, because the safe end of an unanswered
"may I delete this" is no.

Threads: the server is a `ThreadingHTTPServer` in a daemon thread, and every
piece of shared state below is behind one `Condition` - which is also how a
long poll waits without spinning, and how `ask` blocks the main thread until
an answer arrives or the deadline passes.
