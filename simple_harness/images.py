"""Reading an image so a model can look at it.

Three of the four providers here accept images, and so do a good number of
local models - Ollama reports `vision` in a model's capabilities the same way
it reports `tools`, and the 4B model this harness is built around is one of the
ones that has it. So "show it the screenshot" stopped being a thing only the
hosted tools could do, and the only reason it did not work here was that
nothing turned a file into the shape an API wants.

**A message carries paths, not pixels.** An image rides on the message as a
sibling key, `message["images"]`, holding file paths; the bytes are read and
base64-encoded in `providers.py` on the way out and never stored. Two reasons,
and the second is the one that decided it:

* `content` is a string everywhere in this program - `merge_runs` concatenates
  it, `context` trims it, `session` replays it, and invariant 5.3 requires the
  history to be plain text so that one format reaches all of them. A parallel
  key leaves every one of those untouched.
* a session file is written after every turn. A 400KB screenshot is 550KB of
  base64, in every saved copy of a conversation it appears in, forever. The
  path is forty bytes. The cost of that choice is that deleting the file
  afterwards means a resumed session cannot show it again - which is said out
  loud when it happens, rather than being discovered as a strange reply.

**Big images are made smaller rather than refused.** A photograph off a phone
is 12MB and no provider will take it, but the person attaching it is not
thinking about that; they want the harness to deal with it. So it is resized to
`IMAGE_MAX_EDGE` on the long side, which is the size the hosted providers scale
to anyway, and re-encoded. Pillow does the work and is in `requirements.txt`;
without it, an image over the ceiling is refused with the size named, because
sending it would fail further away from the person who could fix it.
