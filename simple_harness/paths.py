"""Where the harness keeps what outlives a session.

Everything personal - the conversations, the long-term memory, the input
history, the saved API keys - lives under one directory, `~/.localchat`.

It used to be split. Keys went to `~/.localchat`, and `sessions/`,
`memory.json` and `.chat_history` were written into whatever directory the
harness happened to start in. That was survivable while it was run as
`python app.py` from its own checkout, and stopped being survivable the moment
it became a command you can run anywhere: starting it in a home directory left
files there, starting it in two projects gave you two unrelated memories, and
`/sessions` only ever listed the ones belonging to wherever you were standing.

What stays per-directory is the part that is genuinely about a project rather
than about you: `.permissions.json`, `.mcp.json` and `skills/`, each of which
is read from the working directory first and from here second.

`LOCALCHAT_HOME` overrides the location - useful for keeping two profiles
apart, and how the tests get a directory of their own instead of the real one.

Stdlib only, and it imports nothing local. `config` builds the system prompt at
import time (ARCHITECTURE 5.2), so the modules below it cannot import `config`;
they can import this.
