"""Run the project's own checks after an edit, and hand a failure back.

A model that has just written a file says it is done. It has not run anything -
often it never occurs to it to, and a small one that is told to check its work
in the system prompt forgets by the third tool call. So the file is wrong, the
turn ends, and the person finds out by running the program themselves, copying
the traceback, and pasting it back in. That round trip is the single most
repeated thing anybody does with a harness like this.

This closes it. When a tool changes a file, the harness works out what kind of
project the file belongs to, runs that project's own check once the turn's tool
calls are done, and if it fails, puts the failure in front of the model as a
message. The model reads a concrete error and fixes it, which is the kind of
work a 4B model is actually good at - far easier than noticing unprompted that
something might be wrong.

Three things keep it from being worse than the problem:

* **It only runs what the project already declares.** No check is invented: a
  marker file has to be there (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`,
  `go.mod`), the runner has to be installed, and for npm the `test` script has
  to be a real one rather than the placeholder `npm init` writes.
* **It is bounded.** `VERIFY_TIMEOUT` seconds, no stdin, output trimmed to the
  tail where the failure actually is. A suite that runs over the timeout turns
  itself off for the rest of the session rather than costing that every edit.
* **It gives up.** `llm_client` stops feeding failures back after three in a
  row and tells the model to explain itself instead, the same way it stops a
  model knocking on a refused tool.

`/undo` is what makes the whole thing safe: every retry is its own commit, so a
loop that went the wrong way is undone one step at a time.

Nothing here raises. A check that cannot run is not an error - it is a project
without that kind of check, which is most of them.
