"""Commit each AI edit on its own, so any of them can be taken back.

An assistant that edits files is only as usable as its undo. Without one the
honest advice is "commit before you let it touch anything", which nobody
follows, and a wrong edit three tools ago is unrecoverable. With one, a bad
edit costs a single command.

So every file a tool changes is committed by itself, under a message that says
which tool did it:

    ai(edit_file): context.py

`/undo` then takes the top commit back if - and only if - the harness made it.
A commit the user wrote is never touched, and neither is work they have not
committed: `undo` refuses rather than destroying anything it did not create.

Only the paths a tool actually named are committed. Anything else the user has
staged or changed is left exactly as it was, which is why `git commit` is given
those paths explicitly rather than being allowed to sweep up the index.

Stdlib only, and it shells out to `git` rather than taking a dependency: git is
already on any machine this matters on, and its command line is far more stable
than any binding for it.
