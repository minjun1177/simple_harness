"""A shared board, so two harnesses in one project do not fight over it.

People run several of these at once - one terminal planning, one writing tests,
one chasing a bug - and until now none of them knew the others existed. Two
agents would read the same file, each edit their own idea of it, and the second
write would silently throw the first one away. Nothing in the harness could
even notice: every instance is its own process with its own history.

So the instances working in one place get somewhere to talk, and something to
talk about.

**Where "one place" is.** The git working tree, or the current directory when
there is no repository. Two terminals opened at `~/proj` and `~/proj/src` are
working on the same thing and must see each other, and `git rev-parse` is the
only thing on the machine that already knows where the edges of a project are.

**What the board holds.** One JSON file per workspace, under `~/.localchat`
rather than in the project - it is scratch state about who is running right
now, not something to commit, and a directory that appears inside somebody's
repository the first time they open two terminals would be a rude surprise.

    agents    who is here: id, pid, model, what they are doing, last seen
    messages  what they have said to each other, newest last
    claims    which files somebody is in the middle of changing

**How a conflict is actually prevented.** Talking is not enough - the same
reasoning as everywhere else in this codebase: asking a model to coordinate
does not make it coordinate. A file another live agent has claimed is refused
in `dispatch_tool`, by name, with the holder named back. And a claim is taken
automatically by the agent that writes a file, so the protection does not
depend on the model having thought to ask for one.

Claims expire (`CHANNEL_CLAIM_TTL`, and a shorter `CHANNEL_WRITE_TTL` for the
automatic ones) and die with the process that took them, because the failure
mode to avoid is one crashed terminal locking a file for the afternoon.

**Concurrency.** Several processes write here. Every change is a locked
read-modify-write, and the write itself goes through `atomic.py`, so a reader
sees one whole board or the previous whole board - never half of each. The lock
is a file created with `O_EXCL`, is broken when its holder has clearly died,
and is *given up on* after `_LOCK_WAIT`: a lost message is a bad afternoon, but
a harness that hangs at the prompt because another one died holding a lock is
a worse one.
