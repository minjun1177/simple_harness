"""What the model learned about *this* project, kept as markdown.

Long-term memory (`session.py`) is about the person: their name, how they want
to be worked with, a standing rule that holds wherever they are. It is one flat
store shared by every project, and it is JSON, which is the right shape for a
fact in a sentence and the wrong shape for a paragraph with a list in it.

What it has no room for is the other half of what is worth keeping: why this
repository does the odd thing it does, the order its deploy runs in, the three
questions nobody has answered yet. That knowledge is per project - it is wrong
everywhere else - and it is prose, often with headings and code in it.

So notes are a second store with different rules:

* **Per project.** `channel.workspace()` decides what a project is - the git
  working tree, or the current directory when there is no repository - so a
  terminal opened in `src/` sees the same notes as one opened at the root.
  Two projects called `chat` do not share notes; `paths.workspace_slug` is
  what keeps them apart, and it is the same name the channel board uses.

* **One note is one file.** `~/.localchat/notes/<project>/<id>.md`. The file
  *is* the record: its name is the id, its mtime is when it was last written,
  and its bytes are the whole content. There is no index beside it to fall out
  of step with what is on disk, and a person can open the directory in any
  editor and have it make sense.

* **Markdown, stored as written.** No frontmatter, no injected heading, no
  escaping on the way in or out. The model writes the body in a `<content>`
  raw block, which is the same route file bodies take and for the same reason:
  a 4B model asked to JSON-escape a fenced code block will get it wrong.

* **Under `~/.localchat`, not in the project.** These are notes a model wrote
  about someone's repository, and a directory that appears inside it the first
  time the harness is used would be a rude surprise - the same reasoning that
  puts the channel board there (`paths.py`).

What reaches the system prompt is the list of titles and nothing else. The body
of every note would be unbounded prompt paid for on every turn; the titles are
what a fresh session is missing, because a session that does not know a note
exists has no reason to call `read_note`.
