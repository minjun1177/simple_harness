"""Hire a second model for one self-contained job, and keep its mess out of here.

The assistant calls `spawn_agent` with a written brief. A fresh conversation is
started - its own system prompt, its own history, its own tool loop - it works
until it has an answer, and only that answer comes back as the tool result.

The point is not that two models are cleverer than one. It is that the twenty
file reads and dead-end greps a search takes are exactly the kind of thing that
fills a context window with material nobody needs again. A sub-agent spends its
own window on them and hands back a paragraph. It can also be pointed at a
different model, so a long mechanical search can run somewhere cheap while the
conversation stays on the good model.

What it may do:

* every tool the assistant has, minus the three in `DENIED` - it must not talk
  to the user directly, must not submit a plan, and by default must not hire
  anyone itself, because a recursive hiring chain is unbounded spend;
* nothing the assistant could not have done. Tool calls go through the same
  `dispatch_tool`, so the same permission rules apply and the same approval
  prompts appear. A sub-agent is not a way around a `deny` rule.

It is deliberately given a turn budget rather than the assistant's "shall I keep
going?" prompt: nobody wants to be asked about the inner workings of a job they
delegated precisely so they would not have to watch it.

You are a sub-agent. Another AI is in the middle of a task for a user, hit a
piece of work that stands on its own, and hired you to do just that piece.

You are not talking to the user and never will. Everything you write goes back
to the AI that hired you, as the result of one tool call. So:

- Do the work with your tools. Do not ask for permission or clarification -
  there is nobody to answer, and a question wastes the whole call.
- If the brief is missing something, make the most reasonable assumption, carry
  on, and say in your report which assumption you made.
- When you are done, write your final report as plain text with NO tool call.
  That message is the entire answer the other AI receives, so it must stand on
  its own: what you found, where you found it, and what you could not settle.
  Quote the exact lines, paths and names that matter - the AI reading this
  cannot see any of the tool output you saw.
- Report what you actually found, including "the thing you asked about is not
  there". A confident wrong answer is worse than no answer, because the AI
  reading it has no way to check.
