"""What the harness does to the machine it runs on, shown once before it does it.

This is not a second licence. Apache-2.0 already disclaims warranty (section 7)
and limits liability (section 8), and it governs either way - agreeing here adds
nothing to it and refusing takes nothing away. What this adds is that the
disclaimer is *read*: a licence file nobody opens is a poor way to tell someone
that the program they just installed is about to run shell commands on their
computer at a language model's suggestion.

So it says plainly what the harness can do, points at the licence for the legal
part, and asks once. The answer is kept in `~/.localchat` and never asked again
unless the terms change.

Stdlib plus `atomic` and `paths`, both of which import nothing local.

Simple Harness gives a language model tools that act on this computer.

  * It runs shell commands, and they run as you, with your permissions.
  * It creates, edits and deletes files in whatever directory you start it in.
  * It makes network requests, and if you connect a hosted provider it sends
    your prompts - including file contents it has read - to that provider.

A language model can be wrong about any of it. The approval prompt is what
stands between a suggestion and it happening, and `/automode on`, an `allow`
rule and a trusted MCP server each remove that prompt for what they cover.

Use version control, or a copy you can afford to lose. `/undo` takes back the
last file change the harness committed; it cannot take back a shell command.
