"""Tool permission rules: what runs without asking, and what never runs.

Until now the only gate was the approval prompt, and `/automode on` turned it
off for everything at once - including `run_cmd` and `delete_file`. Rules give
the middle ground: wave through the calls you make twenty times a day, and put
a hard stop in front of the ones you never want.

Rules live in `.permissions.json` (project) and `~/.localchat/permissions.json`
(personal); both are read and their rules combined.

    {
      "allow": ["read_file", "run_cmd(git status)", "mcp__github__*"],
      "deny":  ["delete_file", "run_cmd(rm *)", "write_file(*/.env)"]
    }

A rule is a tool name, optionally followed by a pattern in parentheses that is
matched against the call's main argument - the command for `run_cmd`, the path
for a file tool, the URL for a network tool. Both halves accept `*` and `?`
wildcards. A pattern with no wildcard also matches anything that starts with it
followed by a space, so `run_cmd(git status)` covers `git status --short`.

`deny` wins over `allow`, and anything unmatched falls through to the approval
prompt exactly as before - an empty rule set changes nothing.
