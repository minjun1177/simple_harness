"""What every built-in tool is, in one place.

The tool list used to live twice: as a hand-written JSON array inside the system
prompt, and again as a chain of `if function_name == ...` branches that pulled
the arguments back out. Nothing tied the two together, so a parameter renamed in
one and not the other produced a tool the model would call correctly and the
harness would silently run with an empty string.

Now both are read from the table below. The prompt is rendered from it, dispatch
binds arguments through it, and `tools.py` refuses to import if a tool in the
table has no handler or a handler has no entry - so the two cannot drift apart
without the program saying so on the way up.

Parameters are listed in the order the handler takes them. Three flags cover
what the old JSON could not say:

* `block`   - the value arrives in a raw <name> block after the JSON, not
              inside it, so it must be kept out of the advertised parameters.
* `hidden`  - accepted if sent, but not advertised. Older argument shapes.
* `aliases` - other keys a model reaches for. `send_input` gets `input` and
              `text` as often as `stdin`, and refusing them helps nobody.

Stdlib only, and imports nothing from the harness: both `tools.py` and
`systemprompt.py` depend on it, so it must be able to depend on neither.

    Vendor-neutral: name, description, and a JSON Schema for the arguments.
    Each provider reshapes this into its own wire format - see `encode_tools`
    on the providers - so all three describe the same set of tools by
    construction.

    The wording differs from `prompt_schema` where it has to. Raw <content>
    blocks are a workaround for models that can only emit text; over a native
    interface the parameter carries the file body directly, so `write_file`
    here has a `content` parameter and does not mention blocks at all.
