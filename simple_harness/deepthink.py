"""A mode that makes one request into a chain: plan, check, build, review, verify.

Asked to implement something, a model goes straight at it. It writes code from
what it remembers of a file rather than what the file says, and when it is done
it reports success without ever running the thing. Both failures come from the
same place: one pass, with no step that exists only to find fault.

So the turn is broken into five, and the harness drives them rather than asking
the model to remember to:

    1  plan     work out what it takes - read the files, change nothing
    2  check    argue against that plan and settle every assumption
    3  build    carry out the plan as it now stands
    4  review   read the diff of what actually changed, and fix what is wrong
    5  verify   run it, and report what really came back

Each stage sees everything the ones before it did, so it is one conversation,
not five. What changes is the instruction at the top of each turn.

Two of these are worth more than the rest. Stage 2 is the only one whose job is
to find the plan wrong, and a plan nobody argued with is usually the one that
fails. Stage 4 is handed the **real diff** from git rather than being asked what
it changed - reviewing from memory finds nothing, because the memory is of the
intention, not of the code.

The mode is off by default and toggled with `/deepthink`. It costs five turns
where one would do, which is worth it for a change to real code and a waste for
a question - so stage 1 is allowed to end the chain when there is nothing to
build.

Be concrete - name the files, functions and lines you have actually looked at.

Change NOTHING in this stage. The tools that change things are switched off
until stage 3, so trying one only wastes a turn.

- What else does this touch? Who calls it, who imports it, what tests cover it?
- Which case does the plan not handle?
- Is there a simpler change that does the same job?

Read whatever you need to settle each point - do not reason it out in your head
when a tool can tell you.

plainly which of your assumptions turned out to be wrong.

  now raises where it used to return will break its callers and its tests.

  longer describes what the thing does, an import you added and never used?

Prove it works. Do not describe it working.

Run it with `run_cmd` - the test suite, the script, the command, whatever
actually exercises what you changed - and report what came back.

Go through the original request point by point and check each point directly.
The tests that already existed were written before your change and know nothing
about it - passing them is not proof you did what was asked. If the request said
a broken line must be skipped, feed it a broken line and look. If it said the
file must be read one line at a time, check that it is. A green test suite that
never touches the thing you changed proves nothing about it.

Find out how a test is meant to be run before you guess. Read the test file: a file
whose tests are plain functions under `if __name__ == "__main__"` is run with
`python3 <file>`, not through unittest. "No tests ran", "file not found" and
"command not found" are not results - they mean you ran the wrong thing. Fix the
command and run it again.

Then report honestly:
- what you ran, and what it said;
- what passed;
- what failed, with the real output;
- what you could not check, and why.

Then stop. If you could not verify it, the answer is "I could not verify it" -
do not follow that with a summary saying it works. You have not earned that
sentence, and the person reading it will believe you.""", edits=True),
