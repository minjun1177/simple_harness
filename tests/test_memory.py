"""A memory marked important is in the prompt before the first message.

Long-term memory only pays off if the model goes looking for it, and a fresh
session has no reason to look: nothing in it says there is anything to find.
`write_memory` with `important` set is the answer to that - the memory is
written into the system prompt when the prompt is built, which is the start of
every session, so the model has it before the user has typed anything.

What the checks below are actually protecting:

* the mark survives being saved over. A model that rewrites "User name" a month
  later, without thinking about `important`, must not silently demote the one
  fact the user asked to be remembered - but an explicit `false` must still
  take the mark away, or there would be no way back.
* the block is bounded. It is in the prompt, and the prompt is paid for on
  every turn: forty memories of a thousand characters each would quietly eat
  the context window that the conversation needs.
* it is byte-identical between builds. The prompt is a cache prefix (invariant
  in `providers.py`), and a set iterated into text, or a clock, would cost a
  cache miss on every request instead of none.
* resuming re-reads it. A session picked up tomorrow is a session start too,
  and the block saved into its file is yesterday's.
