"""The documentation has to describe the program that exists.

The tool table stopped drifting from the prompt once one generated the other.
Prose cannot be generated, but it can be checked: this fails when README.md or
ARCHITECTURE.md names something that is gone, or misses something that is new.

It caught, on the day it was written, a tool count three behind, an install
command with the filename misspelled, and a paragraph describing behaviour that
had been replaced two features ago.
