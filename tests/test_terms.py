"""The terms are shown before the harness can act, and asked only once.

Apache-2.0 governs whether or not anyone reads it. What this gate is for is
that somebody who just ran `pip install simple-harness` is told, before the
first turn, that the thing they installed runs shell commands on their computer
at a language model's suggestion.

So the checks are: it asks when it has not been answered, it does not ask twice,
a refusal starts nothing and records nothing, and with no terminal to ask it
refuses rather than hanging or assuming.
