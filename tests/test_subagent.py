"""The sub-agent: what it may do, what it may not, and what comes back.

Driven by a scripted provider rather than a real model, so the checks are about
the harness's behaviour and not the model's mood. The one thing that matters
most is the last section: only the report crosses back, never the twenty tool
results the sub-agent waded through to write it.
