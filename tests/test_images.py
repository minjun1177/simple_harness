"""An image reaching a model that can see it, and not reaching one that cannot.

Vision is the one capability here that fails *quietly* when it is missing. A
hosted API rejects an image it cannot take and says so; Ollama drops it on the
way in, and the model then answers about the sentence alone - fluently, and
about a picture it was never shown. So most of what is checked below is about
refusing early and saying why, rather than about the encoding.

What the checks are actually protecting:

* the four wire formats. Each provider wants images somewhere different, and
  `media_type` has to travel with the bytes - a resized GIF that leaves here
  still labelled `image/gif` arrives as garbage.
* `content` stays a string. Invariant 5.3 wants the stored history plain text,
  so an image rides beside it as a path; `merge_runs` must not throw the
  attachment away when a tool result lands on top of it, and a session must not
  carry base64 around forever.
* a model that cannot see is told before the request, not after.
* `@shot.png` is not read as text. A PNG read as UTF-8 is a screenful of
  nothing that costs a thousand tokens to say it.
