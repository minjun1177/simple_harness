"""`@path` attachments and the `!` shell escape - the two things that act on the
line the user typed rather than on a slash command.

The checks that matter here are the ones about *not* firing: an email address is
not a mention, a decorator pasted into a question is not a mention, and a path
that does not exist must leave the message alone rather than stopping the turn.
The completer is checked against a real directory, because the whole point of it
is that the path comes off disk instead of out of memory.
