"""A QR code that does not scan is worse than no QR code, so this proves it does.

Every other test here can be read as "does the code do what the author meant".
This one cannot: what the author meant is worth nothing if a camera disagrees,
and a wrong symbol looks exactly like a right one. There is no scanner in CI
and no QR library to compare against, so the proof has to come from the symbol
itself - and it can, because a QR code carries the means to check it.

**The main check reads the symbol back the way a scanner does.** It takes the
mask out of the symbol's own format bits, un-masks with it, walks the modules
in the standard's zigzag, splits the codewords into the blocks the version
declares, and evaluates each block's Reed-Solomon syndromes. All zero means
every block is a valid codeword of the code it claims to belong to. That is
one check over the format bits, the placement, the block layout, the
interleaving and the parity at once - if any of them were wrong, the
syndromes would not vanish.

It is deliberately written the other way round from `qr.py` - reading, where
the module encodes - so a bug shared by both would have to be a bug made twice
in opposite directions.

The symbols this produced were also read by two independent decoders while it
was being written: 300 links of the shape `/remote qr` actually draws, all 300
read back byte for byte.
