"""State that is not the shape the code assumed, and what it used to cost.

Everything here is a file or a value that reaches the harness from somewhere it
does not control - a session written by another version, a `memory.json` edited
by hand, a number typed at `/set` - and every check is one that raised where it
should have carried on.

The one that matters most is the first. A message whose `content` is `null`
goes into the history and stays there, so the `startswith` it breaks is not one
failed turn: it is that turn and every later one, until the conversation is
cleared. `_raw_estimate` had always guarded against it and nothing else had.

The file-writing half is the other kind. `edit_file` and `write_file` opened
the target with `open(path, "w")`, which truncates first and writes second - the
exact thing `atomic.py` exists to prevent, applied everywhere in the harness
except to the user's own source files. The line endings came with it: a read
through universal newlines and a write through `os.linesep` turns a whole file
from Unix endings to Windows ones, so a one-line edit reads as a rewrite.
