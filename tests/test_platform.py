"""Check how well this machine can tell "waiting for input" from "busy".

`run_cmd` keeps a command alive and hands its prompt to the model when it stops
printing. Deciding that it really has stopped is the hard part, and what is
available to decide it with differs by platform:

    output ends without a newline   everywhere   it is shaped like a prompt
    /proc says read() on fd 0       Linux        it really is waiting on stdin
    the process tree burns no CPU   Windows/mac  it is idle, but so is a sleep
    silence for CMD_WAIT_TIMEOUT    everywhere   nothing better was available

It also checks that non-ASCII text survives the trip in both directions, which
is where Windows differs most: a Python older than 3.15 prints to a pipe in the
console code page, not UTF-8.

Run this after changing anything in `shell_session.py`, and on any machine the
harness is new to - especially Windows, where `/proc` is unavailable and the
weaker CPU signal has to carry it:

    python tests/test_platform.py

On Linux both paths are exercised: the second run switches `/proc` off, which
leaves exactly the code Windows and macOS run. Exits non-zero if anything fails.
