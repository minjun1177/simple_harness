"""One door into a running session, and everything that must not get through it.

`/remote` is the only feature here that opens a port, and what is behind that
port is a shell. So the checks that matter most are the refusals: that a
request without the token is answered with nothing, that a wrong token is not
almost-right, that a `Host` naming somebody else's domain - which is what a
rebound DNS name looks like on the wire - is turned away before the token is
even considered, and that closing it really closes it.

The rest is about the two ways this could quietly lose or leak something: a
transcript that carries a `.env` value off this machine because the person ran
`!cat .env`, and a question answered by a phone that was still showing the
last one. Both are tested against the real server, over real HTTP, on a port
the operating system picks.

A second process is not needed here: the server genuinely runs in a thread of
its own, so a request from this one is already a request from somewhere else.
