"""Three things a person could not change without editing source.

`config.py` was the only way to change `NUM_CTX`, an API key could be typed in
and never taken back out, and the banner assumed a terminal tall enough to
print it into. Each of those is somebody having to work around the program
rather than use it.

What is checked here is the part that would break quietly: that the settings
file only ever records what was actually changed, that a broken one still
lets the harness start, that deleting a key deletes the key and nothing else,
and that the welcome screen fits the terminal it is printed into.
