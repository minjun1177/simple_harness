"""Markdown notes, filed per project, and the titles that reach the prompt.

Long-term memory is about the person and follows them everywhere. Notes are the
other half: what is true about *one* repository - why it does the odd thing it
does, the order its deploy runs in, what is still open - and they are markdown,
because that knowledge is a paragraph with a list in it rather than a fact in a
sentence.

What the checks below are actually protecting:

* two projects do not share notes, and one project is the same project from any
  directory inside it. `channel.workspace()` answers both, and a note written
  from `src/` has to be the note read from the root.
* the file is the record. Its name is the id and its bytes are the content -
  there is no index beside it, so nothing can disagree with what is on disk,
  and a person can open the directory in an editor.
* a note id becomes a filename, and the model picks it. `../../.ssh/config`
  must not be a way to write outside the notes directory, in either of the two
  places that is stopped.
* markdown survives the round trip exactly. Headings, fences and blank lines
  come back as they went in; the body travels as a raw block precisely so it
  never has to be JSON-escaped.
* the prompt gets titles and nothing else, capped, and byte-identical between
  builds - it is a cache prefix, and an mtime ordering would reshuffle it on
  every write.
