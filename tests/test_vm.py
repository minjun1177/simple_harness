"""The Python scratch VM: what it remembers, and what it does when it dies.

`run_python` exists for the model the whole harness is built around - one too
small to hold an intermediate result in its head, and too small to escape a
snippet of code into a JSON string. So the two things worth testing hardest are
the two that make it worth having:

* the code arrives through a `<content>` block, byte for byte, exactly as
  `write_file` does - checked through the real parser, not by calling the
  handler directly;
* what one call defines is still there in the next one.

The rest is about dying honestly. A VM that is killed for running too long has
lost every variable in it, and a model told only "that failed" will go on
referring to them - so each of the three ways it can die is checked for saying
so out loud.
