"""Auto-verify: the right check, once, bounded, and only when it can run.

The loop is worth having only if it is quiet when there is nothing to check.
A harness that runs somebody's whole test suite because a `.md` file changed,
or that runs it four times for four edits in one reply, is worse than one that
runs nothing. So most of what is checked here is restraint:

* the check is chosen by the written file's extension, not by whichever marker
  turns up first;
* a marker above the git working tree belongs to somebody else's project;
* `npm init`'s placeholder test script is not a test suite;
* four files in one turn are one run;
* a suite that runs past the timeout turns itself off instead of costing that
  again after every edit.

Then the part it exists for: a failing check comes back as a message the model
can act on, and after three of those the harness stops asking.

The four real checks need pytest, npm, cargo or go installed to *run*, so the
running is done against a check defined here - one that always exists and can
be made to pass, fail, or hang on demand. What the real table is asked is what
it selects, which is the part that has to be right on a machine with none of
them.
