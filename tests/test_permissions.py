"""Permission rules: what a rule covers, and what it must not quietly cover.

Two of these were real holes rather than hypotheticals.

`run_cmd(git status)` is the first rule README.md teaches and the first line of
`.permissions.json.example`. A rule is matched against the command as text, so
that rule also matched `git status && rm -rf ~` - and `allow` means no prompt,
and `run_cmd` runs its command through a shell. One rule written to skip the
prompt on a read-only command waved through anything appended to it.

`write_file()` reads to a person as "calls with no arguments" and used to mean
the opposite: `matches()` treats an empty pattern as "match everything", so a
stray pair of brackets granted `write_file` over every path on the machine.

Neither is caught by the other test files, and both are silent when wrong.
