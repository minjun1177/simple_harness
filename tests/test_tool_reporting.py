"""What a tool result is allowed to say about itself, and what stays off stderr.

Two ways a working tool used to look like a broken one:

* The footer under a result searched the whole body for `[Error]`. A page
  `get_url` fetched that discusses an error, a file whose source raises one, a
  `grep` that matched the word - all came back complete and were labelled a
  failure. The markers are anchors, and this checks they are read as anchors.
* Beautiful Soup writes a paragraph to stderr when a page turns out to be XML,
  or when markup is short enough to look like a filename - which a search
  snippet often is. It is printed from the fetch threads, mid-search, and reads
  like the tool failed while the content comes back fine.
