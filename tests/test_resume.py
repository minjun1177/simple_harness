"""Picking up a conversation instead of starting a new one.

`--resume <id>` and `-c` are the only two things that cannot be slash commands:
by the time there is a prompt to type at, a new session has already begun. Both
resolve on the command line, before the screen is cleared, and neither is
allowed to quietly hand back a blank session when it finds nothing - which is
what most of the checks below are about.

`-c` means "the session I was last in *here*", so a session file has to record
the directory it was worked in. Files written before it did have nothing to
match on, and must never be guessed at.
