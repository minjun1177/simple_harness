"""`/tdd`: the test files are locked for one request, and then they are not.

"Make this test pass" is a request models answer by editing the test - loosening
the assertion until it is true, or deleting it. Asking them not to does not
work, for the same reason it does not work in a planning stage: a small model
that is stuck takes the opening it is given. So the opening is closed at the
dispatcher, through the permission rules that already sit there.

What is checked here is the part that would be quietly wrong: that the patterns
reach a test file however its path is written and leave the code under test
alone, that the refusal really comes from `dispatch_tool` rather than from the
handler, and - the one that matters most - that the lock *lifts*. A lock nobody
remembers turning on is worse than no lock, so it is armed for one turn and
released in a `finally`, including when that turn raised.
