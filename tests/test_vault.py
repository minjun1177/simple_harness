"""`.env` values the model is never told, and the harness pastes in itself.

A `.env` is the one file whose contents *are* the secret, and a value the model
reads does not stay read: it goes to the provider, and it is written into
`~/.localchat/sessions/*.json` and stays there. One `read_file` and a key is in
two places nobody would think to check.

So the model is shown `STRIPE_KEY={{env:STRIPE_KEY}}` and, when it writes that
placeholder into something that *runs*, the harness puts the real value in on
the way to the tool. The checks below are the ones that decide whether that is
a feature or a leak with extra steps:

* the value never reaches the model, by any of the four routes it could take;
* the placeholder does reach the shell as the real key, so the model can use a
  secret it has never seen;
* and it is never written *into* a file, in either direction - not expanded on
  the way in, and not allowed to overwrite the value it names.

The last one is the one worth staring at. `{{env:X}}` expanded into a file body
would be a copy-out: write it, read it back, and the model has the key. The
same placeholder written over `.env` would be a copy-*away*: the key replaced
by its own name, by a model that cannot see either and would never know.
