"""Live shell sessions: run a command, and talk to it while it is still running.

A captured `subprocess.run` can only ever report what a command printed after it
finished, which is no use for anything that asks a question. Here the process is
kept alive instead: its output is drained continuously, and the moment it goes
quiet - which is what a program waiting at a prompt looks like from outside - the
output so far is handed to the model, which replies with the next line.

Deciding *when* it has gone quiet for good is the whole difficulty: silence
alone cannot tell a program waiting at a prompt from one that is busy. What is
available differs by platform, so the best signal each one offers is used - see
`read_until_idle`. None of them is certain, so the model is told the program is
*probably* waiting, and can send an empty input to keep listening instead.

Stdlib only, so this stays importable from anywhere in the harness.
